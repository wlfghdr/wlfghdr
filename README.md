👋 Hi, I’m Wolfgang “wlfghdr”,

Machines making Machines! — because building systems that build other systems isn’t just clever — it’s how we scale the next era of work.  ￼
	•	🧠 Principal Product Manager, deeply into AI-driven observability, agentic systems, and engineering productivity.  ￼
	•	💡 I explore how agentic enterprises (software that runs processes autonomously, with governance and observability) will reshape how products are built and operated.  ￼
	•	🔧 I run experiments locally and in the cloud — from PoCs to overnight agentic company simulators.

🚀 What I Build

I like pragmatic tools and experiments that actually solve real developer and organizational problems, not hype:
	•	⚙️ Strong believer in product velocity with control — faster feedback loops with observability as the control plane.  ￼
	•	🤖 Agent-first ideas: local agent frameworks, orchestration experiments, AI that reliably does work, not just chat.
	•	🧪 Side projects born in waiting rooms and spare minutes — anything that scratches a practical itch.

💼 Work & Contributions ￼

If you want to collaborate on stuff that:
	•	scales engineering outcomes,
	•	automates what should be automated, and
	•	preserves control and trust in the loop …

… shoot me a message on LinkedIn. ⬆️
